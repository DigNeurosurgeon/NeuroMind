        <h3>About Pieter Kubben, MD, PhD</h3>
        
        <p>Pieter Kubben is a staff neurosurgeon who works at the Maastricht University Medical Center in The Netherlands and performed a PhD thesis on glioma surgery with intraoperative MRI. His current focus is on functional neurosurgery (deep brain stimulation, epilepsy surgery, and brain computer interfaces). He is part-time employed at the department of medical information technology to develop new innovative approaches in eHealth and mHealth.</p>
        
        <p>As a hobby, he started developing software for mobile computing and clinical decision support. Starting in 2001, he has won two international awards for his efforts in PHP &amp; MySQL.</p>
        
        <p>In 2010 he released three medical iPhone apps, and became IT editor and associate editor-in-chief of the open-access journal Surgical Neurology International. One of his apps, called NeuroMind, became the #1 ranked app for neurosurgery worldwide. It has been mentioned three times in the widely cited &quot;Top Apps&quot; on iMedicalApps.com.</p>
        
        <p>In 2011 he gave a TEDx talk explaining his philosophy behind the apps, and his vision on clinical decision supporting systems (CDSS). Such systems are implemented in NeuroMind 2.0 which was released in April 2012.</p>
        
        <p>Twice he was named one of the &quot;Top Ten Internet-Smart Doctors in the World&quot; by the weblog InternetMedicine.com, both for 2012 and for 2013.</p>

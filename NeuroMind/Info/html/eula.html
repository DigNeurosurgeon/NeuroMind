The Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.</p>
        
        <h5>9.2 ARBITRATION, CHOICE OF FORUM AND VENUE</h5>
        
        <p>Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration in The Netherlands, by a single arbitrator.

The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of the arbitration and reasonable costs for experts and other witnesses. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed as preventing either party from seeking provisional relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, in order to protect that partyâ€™s name or proprietary rights. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties without appeal or review except as permitted by Dutch law.</p>
        
        <h5>9.3 WAIVER</h5>
        
        <p>The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by either party of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself.</p>

In lieu of the unenforceable provision, the parties will substitute or add as part of this Agreement a provision that will be as similar as possible in economic and business objectives as was intended by the unenforceable provision.</p>
